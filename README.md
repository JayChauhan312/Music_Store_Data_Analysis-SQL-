# Music_Store_Data_Analysis-SQL-
      
- In this project, I am working on an end-to-end SQL project analyzing a digital music store database. This project involves importing the database into MySQL and solving a       series of SQL queries ranging from easy to advanced levels.

What Iâ€™m doing:
- Setting up and importing the database into MySQL.
- Writing SQL queries to explore and analyze music store data
- Progressing from basic to complex query challenges
- Applying real-world data analysis techniques using SQL

- This project helps me build confidence in SQL and prepares me for data science roles by working with authentic datasets.
